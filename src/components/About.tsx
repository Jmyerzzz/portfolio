                My name is Jackson Myers and I&apos;m a software engineer from
                the Bay Area. I attended college at Loyola Marymount University
                in Los Angeles, where I remained for work for the the following
                four years. I&apos;ve primarily worked with Node, Python, and
                React with a stronger focus on backend, but I am keen to expand
                my repetoire and work with whatever the job requires.
              </p>

                I previously worked at an enterprise blockchain fintech
                companyâ€”Symbiont. There, I worked with a proprietary language
                called SymPL for smart contract development; the remaining work
                required Node and React. My team and I were working directly
                with stakeholders at Vanguard and State Street Bank on a product
                for foreign exchange derivatives trading.

                Outside of work I enjoy fitness, whether that&apos;s mountain
                biking, snowboarding, or being in the gym. You can find me at
                live music on the weekends. I&apos;m a big fan of jam bands like
                Dead & Company and Goose.
